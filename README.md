# INA-700_STAMP
INA700 Stamp version!

![Preview](https://github.com/Flamingo-tech/INA-700_STAMP/blob/main/INA_700_STAMP_v1.0.0_ATLIUM_FOOTPRINTS/INA700_STAMP_V1.0.png)


Allows for easier integration in projects. Due to the extremely small footprint is is hard to include the INA700 in a project and not creating an expensive PCB. (especially if you want to use multiple in a project with different addresses)

Altium THT and SMT footprints are available :) (Sorry no KiCad if someone can make something I will provide a free STAMP :) )
